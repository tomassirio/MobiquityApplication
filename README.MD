## Mobiquity-Api-Challenge

## :star: Getting started
### :computer: Running the project

- The project should be run on the master branch
- The maven-library for the pack function is already added as a dependency
- Run the project
- You may reach the endpoint via curl with the address localhost:8080/api/v1/packages/packer
- You may use the swagger documentation as well on your browser via localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

### Package Challenge Solution

1. Eventhough there was not a REST API solicited on the challenge, I built one because 
   it further demonstrates the capabilities that'll conform my set of skills on the job
    
2. The Application was created via Springboot and Maven
3. There's a Controller which takes a GET request where the Packer is eventually called
4. At first, both the Packer Library and the REST API where a monolithic application,
However this was separated on two repositories to enhance the application's modularity and scalability
   and also because it was solicited on the assignment.
5. Unit testing was applied with PowerMock
